# Todo list

In this assignment, you will have to refactor an already created application. The goal for these 30 minutes is to make sure that you know Angular and take full advantage of it.

#### You can create all the necessary modules, components and services.
#### You can refactor all the files you have.

### Important:
1. You don't need to run a web server
2. You don't need to run code unless asked to do so by the intreviewer

Your work should result in code that you find acceptable.

Good luck!
